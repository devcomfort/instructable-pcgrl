This project is a web-based demonstration interface for **IPCGRL (Language-Instructed Reinforcement Learning for Procedural Level Generation)**, a research paper accessible on [arXiv:2503.12358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12358). It builds upon the foundational work of the [pcgrl-brush](https://github.com/omardelarosa/pcgrl-brush) project, adapting and extending it to showcase the capabilities of language-instructed AI in procedural content generation.

The backend code that powers the generation logic for this demo resides in the `rlbrushplus` branch of the [k-shyun/Instructed_PCG](https://github.com/k-shyun/Instructed_PCG/tree/rlbrushplus) repository. This frontend is designed to interact with that backend.

## About `pcgrl-brush`

[pcgrl-brush](https://github.com/omardelarosa/pcgrl-brush) is an interactive tool for procedural content generation using reinforcement learning (RL). It provides a user-friendly interface where users can "paint" or provide inputs to guide an RL agent in generating 2D game levels. The goal is to make RL-based PCG more accessible and controllable.

## About IPCGRL

The **IPCGRL** paper introduces a novel approach to procedural content generation by enabling deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to understand and utilize natural language instructions. The core idea is to fine-tune task-specific sentence embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions, allowing users to guide the generation process through text or speech commands. This project serves as a practical demonstration of these concepts.

## Core Technologies

This frontend application is built with modern web technologies:

*   **Svelte & SvelteKit:** For a reactive and compiler-optimized user interface.
*   **TypeScript:** For robust, type-safe JavaScript development.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI development.
*   **Vite:** For fast frontend tooling (dev server, build).

## Features

The RLBrush IPCGRL Demo offers the following key features:

*   üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map Generation:**
    *   Visualize the game map being generated by the AI.
    *   (Potentially) Edit parts of the map or set initial conditions (based on pcgrl-brush capabilities).
*   üí¨ **Instruction-Based Control via Chat:**
    *   **Text Instructions** ‚å®Ô∏è: Type natural language commands (e.g., "make a room in the top left", "add more enemies") into the chatbox to guide the AI's generation process.
    *   **Voice Instructions** üó£Ô∏è: Use the microphone button to provide spoken commands. The application uses the Web Speech API for voice-to-text transcription.
    *   **Instruction History**: View a log of your instructions and the AI's (textual) responses or actions.
    *   **Suggested Prompts**: Get quick ideas for instructions to try out.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Generation Parameters:**
    *   (Likely) Control parameters such as the current "level" or "step count" for the generation process, influencing the AI's behavior.

*(Specific controls and interactions for map editing and parameter adjustment would depend on the full feature set inherited and adapted from pcgrl-brush and implemented for the IPCGRL backend.)*

## Setup and Running the Project

To run this frontend application locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (refer to `.nvmrc` or project's Node version, if specified; otherwise, a recent LTS version).
    *   `pnpm` package manager (as indicated by `packageManager` field in `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`). If you don't have pnpm, install it via `npm install -g pnpm`.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

5.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
    This command will create an optimized static build of the application in the `dist` or `.svelte-kit/output` directory (depending on the adapter used).

## Backend Reminder

This frontend requires the [IPCGRL backend](https://github.com/k-shyun/Instructed_PCG/tree/rlbrushplus) to be running and accessible for the map generation and AI instruction processing features to work. Please ensure the backend is set up and running according to its own instructions.
